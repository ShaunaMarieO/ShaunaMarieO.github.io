				<h2>Knitting</h2>
				<p class="exposition"><i>The one that uses a (variety of) needles. Though different from sewing needles, they're still pointy. Don't poke yourself.</i></p>
				<p class="exposition">A type of craftwork which uses the aforementioned needles by weaving loops of a sort to create a fabric, which may be formed in the shape of a garment or otherwise. Knitting was a method estimated to have been developed during the 11th century CE - the oldest known knitted objects were from then, found in Egypt, and they were complex enough that it's guessed the method had been around even far longer.</p>

				<h2>Crocheting</h2>
				<p class="exposition"><i>The one that uses a (variety of) hooks. These are not precisely pointy, but they still may have sharp edges. Again, don't poke yourself.</i></p>
				<p class="exposition">Another type of craftwork which (typically) uses a single hook, which weaves loops in a manner to create fabrics, albeit in an entirely different manner from knitting.</p>
				<aside><i>Note: A type of crochet known as Tunisian crochet may use more than one of these hooks at a time.</i></aside>
				<p class="exposition">Crochet is newer than knitting, and its first known appearances were in 19th century Europe. The first mention of the specific term was used in a Dutch Magazine in 1823.</p>
