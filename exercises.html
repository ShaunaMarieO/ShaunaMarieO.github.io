			Part 1:
			a) the typeof operator returns the type of operand, in this case the variable z. The alert will state the type.
			b) indicates that a variable is boolean value, meaning true or false. The alert will state the boolean value.
			c) the alert will tell us the remainder when 7 is divided by 2. It is because the modulus is an arithmetic operator.
			d) The alert will return "Wanda Smith", because the value of the variable is "Wanda" and the alert uses that variable in combination with "Smith."
			e) the alert will state the value of the variable myNum plus 2, therefore "7".

			Part 2:
			1. Java is a static language, Javascript is a dynamic language. Javascript is a scripting language that is generally used to add interactivity to webpages and can be added to HTML. Java is used by itself and makes compiled programs.
			2. + is an arithmetic operator that adds values. ++ is an increment operator and adds plus one every time it is run.
			3. window.alert() gives a pop-up, document.write() writes the text on the webpage, and console.log() logs data in a browser's console, if that browser has a console.
			4. = is an assignment operator. == means equal to and compares values, === is strictly equal to and compares both values and data types.
			5. a while loop runs as long as the condition is true. The difference between that and a do while loop is that a do while loop always runs at least one time, even if the condition is false.
